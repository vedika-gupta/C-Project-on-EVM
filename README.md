# C-Project-on-EVM

The main objective of this C project on electronic voting machine is to facilitate the online voting system so that voters can vote from anywhere without going to polling booths. The purpose of this project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work. Counting will be done very quickly and result can be declared within 2-3 hours as compared to 30-40 hours, on an average, under the conventional system.

It is basically made for the classroom voting purpose where the list of the students are in (voters.csv) file and once the vote has been casted the voter's information will add into another csv file (votes.csv). And at the end, it shows the result, total count of votes, the leading candidate, and spoiled votes.
